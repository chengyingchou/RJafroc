## Introduction
* For an ROI dataset calling `StSignificanceTesting()` automatically defaults to `method = "ORH"`, `covEstMethod = "DeLong"` and `FOM = "ROI"`.  

* The covariance estimation method is based on the original DeLong method [@RN112], which is valid only for the trapezoidal AUC, i.e. ROC data, as extended by [@RN1233] to ROI data.  

* The essential differences from conventional ROC analyses are in the definition of the ROI figure of merit, see below, and the procedure developed by [@RN1233] for estimating the covariance matrix. Once the covariances are known, `method = "ORH"` can be applied to perform the significance testing, as described in [@RN2680, Chapter 10].

## The ROI figure of merit  
Let ${{X}_{kr}}$ denote the rating for the r^th^ **lesion-containing** ROI in the k^th^ case and let $n_{k}^{L}$ be the total number of lesion-containing ROIs in the k^th^ case. Similarly, let ${{Y}_{kr}}$ denote the rating for the r^th^ **lesion-free** ROI in the k^th^ case and $n_{k}^{N}$ denote the total number of lesion-free ROIs in the k^th^ case. Let ${{N}_{L}}$ denote the total number of lesion-containing ROIs in the image set and ${{N}_{N}}$ denote the total number of lesion-free ROIs. These are given by ${{N}_{L}}=\sum\nolimits_{k}{n_{k}^{L}}$ and ${{N}_{N}}=\sum\nolimits_{k}{n_{k}^{N}}$. The ROI figure of merit $\theta$\ is defined by: \[\theta =\frac{1}{{{N}_{L}}{{N}_{N}}}\sum\nolimits_{k}{\sum\nolimits_{{{k}'}}{\sum\limits_{r=1}^{n_{k}^{L}}{\sum\limits_{{r}'=1}^{n_{k'}^{N}}{\psi ({{X}_{kr}},{{Y}_{{k}'{r}'}})}}}}\]    

Here the kernel function is defined by:

\[\psi (X,Y)=\left\{ \begin{align}
  & 1.0\ \ \ \text{if}\ Y<X \\ 
 & 0.5\ \ \ \text{if}\ Y=X \\ 
 & 0.0\ \ \ \text{if}\ Y>X \\ 
\end{align} \right.\]


The ROIs are *effectively regarded as mini-cases* and one calculates the FOM as the Wilcoxon statistic considering the mini-cases as actual cases. The correlations between the ratings of ROIs on the same case are accounted for in the analysis.


## Calculation of the ROI figure of merit.

```{r}
UtilFigureOfMerit(datasetROI)
fom <- UtilFigureOfMerit(datasetROI, FOM = "ROI")
```             

* If the correct `FOM` is not supplied, it defaults to `FOM = ROI`.   
* This is a 2-treatment 5-reader dataset.  
* For treatment 1, reader 1 the figure of merit is `r fom[1,1]`.  
* For treatment 2, reader 5 the figure of merit is `r fom[2,5]`.  
* Etc.  

## Significance testing
```{r}
ret <- StSignificanceTesting(datasetROI)
str(ret)
```             

* While `ret` is a list with many (22) members, their meaning should be clear from the notation. As examples:  

+    The variance components are given by:

```{r}
ret$varComp
```             

### RRRC analysis  

```{r}
ret$fRRRC
ret$ddfRRRC
ret$pRRRC
```             

* The F-statistic is `r ret$fRRRC`, with `ndf = 1` and `ddf` = `r ret$ddfRRRC`, which yields a p-value of `r ret$pRRRC`.   

* The confidence interval for the reader averaged difference between the two treatments is given by:
    
```{r}
ret$ciDiffTrtRRRC
```             
    
### FRRC analysis  

```{r}
ret$fFRRC
ret$ddfFRRC
ret$pFRRC
```             

* The F-statistic is `r ret$fFRRC`, with `ndf = 1` and `ddf` = `Inf`, which yields a p-value of `r ret$pFRRC`. 

*  The confidence interval for the reader averaged difference between the two treatments is given by:
    
```{r}
ret$ciDiffTrtFRRC
```             

### RRFC analysis  

```{r}
ret$fRRFC
ret$ddfRRFC
ret$pRRFC
```             

* The F-statistic is `r ret$fRRFC`, with `ndf = 1` and `ddf` = `r ret$ddfRRFC`, which yields a p-value of `r ret$pRRFC`. 

* The confidence interval for the reader averaged difference between the two treatments is given by:
    
```{r}
ret$ciDiffTrtRRFC
```
