## Introduction
* In the Free-response Receiver Operating Characteristic (FROC) paradigm [@RN2453] the observer searches each image for signs of **localized disease** and marks and rates localized regions that are sufficiently suspicious for disease presence. FROC data consists of **mark-rating pairs**, where each mark is a localized-region that was considered sufficiently suspicious for presence of a lesion and the rating is the corresponding confidence level. By adopting a proximity criterion, each mark is classified by the investigator as a lesion localization (LL) - if it is close to a real lesion - or a non-lesion localization (NL) otherwise. 

* The observer assigns a rating to each region. The rating can be an integer or quasi-continuous (e.g., 0 â€“ 100), or a floating point value, as long as higher numbers represent greater confidence in presence of a lesion at the indicated region.

## The Excel data format
The Excel file has three worsheets. These are named `Truth`, `NL` or `FP` and `LL` or `TP`. 

* NL ratings are stored in the `NL` field and LL ratings are stored in the `LL` field.  

## An example FROC dataset

An example simulated FROC dataset is included as `dataset04`.
  
```{r}
str(dataset04)
dataset04$NL[1,1,1,]
mean(dataset04$NL[,,1:100,])
dataset04$NL[1,1,51,]
dataset04$lesionNum[1]
dataset04$LL[1,1,1,]
x <- dataset04$LL;mean(x[is.finite(x)])
```             
Examination of the output reveals that:

* This is a 5-treatment 4-reader dataset, with 100 non-diseased cases and 100 diseased cases.   

* For treatment 1, reader 1, case 1 (the 1st non-diseased case) the 4 ratings are `r dataset04$NL[1,1,1,]`. The mean of all ratings on non-diseased cases is `r mean(dataset04$NL[,,1:100,])`.  

* For treatment 1, reader 1, case 101 (the 1st diseased case) the NL ratings are `r dataset04$NL[1,1,101,][is.finite(dataset04$NL[1,1,101,])]`. The corresponding `$lesionVector` field is `r dataset04$Vector[1]`.   

## The FROC Excel data file
An Excel file in JAFROC format containing corresponding to `dataset04`, is included with the distribution. The first command (below) finds the location of the file and the second command reads it and saves it to a dataset object `ds`.  
```{r}
fileName <- system.file(
    "extdata", "FrocData.xlsx", package = "RJafroc", mustWork = TRUE)
ds <- DfReadDataFile(fileName, newExcelFileFormat = FALSE)
ds$dataType
```             
The `DfReadDataFile` function recognizes that this is an *FROC* dataset. Its structure is similar to the JAFROC format Excel file, with some important differences, noted below. It contains three worksheets:

* The `Truth` worksheet - this indicates which cases are diseased and which are non-diseased.  
    + There are 100 normal cases (labeled 1-100) under column `CaseID` and 100 abnormal cases (labeled 101-200).  
    + The `LesionID` field for each normal case (e.g., `CaseID` = 1) is zero and there is one row per case. For abnormal cases, this field has a variable number of entries, ranging from 1 to 3. As an example, there are two rows for `CaseID` = 51 in the Excel file: one with `LesionID` = 2 and one with `LesionID` = 3.   
    + The `Weights` field is always zero (this field is not used in ROI analysis).

![](images/ROI-FP-2.png){width=40%}

* The `FP` (or `NL`)  worksheet - this lists the ratings of ROI-level-normal regions.  
    + For `ReaderID` = 1, `ModalityID` = 1 and `CaseID` = 1 there are 4 rows, corresponding to the 4 ROI-level-normal regions in this case. The corresponding ratings are `r dataset04$NL[1,1,1,][is.finite(dataset04$NL[1,1,1,])]`. The pattern repeats for other treatments and readers, but the rating are, of course, different.  
    + Each `CaseID` is represented in the `FP` worksheet (a rare exception could occur if a case-level abnormal case has 4 abnormal regions).

![](images/ROI-TP-1.png){width=40%}

* The `TP` (or `LL`) worksheet - this lists the ratings of ROI-level-abnormal regions.  
    + Because normal cases generate TPs, one does not find any entry with `CaseID` = 1-50 in the `TP` worksheet.   
    + The lowest `CaseID` in the `TP` worksheet is 51, which corresponds to the first abnormal case.   
    + There are two entries for this case, corresponding to the two ROI-level-abnormal regions present in this case. Recall that corresponding to this `CaseID` in the `Truth` worksheet there were two entries with `LesionID` = 2 and 3. These must match the `LesionID`'s listed for this case in the `TP` worksheet. Complementing these two entries, in the `FP` worksheet for `CaseID` = 51, there are 2 entries corresponding to the two ROI-level-normal regions in this case.   
    + One should be satisfied that for each abnormal case the sum of the number of entries in the `TP` and `FP` worksheets is always 4.
