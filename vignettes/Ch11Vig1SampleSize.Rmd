## Introduction
Since it plays such a central role in sample size estimation, it is helpful to examine the behavior of the F-distribution. In the following `ndf` = numerator degrees of freedom, `ddf` = denominator degrees of freedom and `ncp` = non-centrality parameter (i.e., the delta appearing in Eqn. (11.6)). 

The use of three functions is demonstrated. 

* `qf(p,ndf,ddf)` is the *quantile* function of the F-distribution for specified values of `ndf` and `ddf`, i.e., the value `x` such that fraction `p` of the area under the F-distribution lies to the right of `x`. Since it is not included as a parameter, the default value, i.e., zero, of `ncp` is used. This is called the *central* F-distribution. 

* `df(x,ndf,ddf,ncp)` is the *pdf* or probability density function of the F-distribution for specified values of `ndf`, `ddf` and `ncp`. 

* `pf(x,ndf,ddf,ncp)` is the probability (or cumulative) distribution function of the F-distribution for specified values of `ndf`, `ddf` and `ncp`.

In the following four values of `ncp` are considered `r ncp <- c(0,2,5,10)` `r ncp`. 

## Illustrating the F-distribution for `ndf` = 2, `ddf` = 10
In the following `fCrit` is the critical value of the F distribution, i.e., that value such that fraction $\alpha$ of the area is to the right of the critical value. It is usually denoted ${{F}_{1-\alpha ,ndf,ddf}}$.

```{r, fig.show='hold'}
ndf <- 2;ddf <- 10;ncp <- c(0,2,5,10)
fCrit <- qf(0.95, ndf,ddf)
cat("critical value of x for rejecting NH is ", fCrit,"\n")
x <- seq(1, 20, 0.1)
myLabel <- c("A", "B", "C", "D")
myLabelIndx <- 1
for (i in 1:length(ncp))
{
  y <- df(x,ndf,ddf,ncp=ncp[i])
  cat("ndf = ", ndf, ", ddf = ", ddf, ", ncp = ", ncp[i], ", prob > fCrit = ", 
      1-pf(fCrit, ndf, ddf, ncp = ncp[i]), "\n")
}  
for (i in 1:length(ncp))
{
  y <- df(x,ndf,ddf,ncp=ncp[i])
  curveData <- data.frame(x = x, pdf = y)
  curvePlot <- ggplot(data = curveData, mapping = aes(x = x, y = pdf)) + 
    geom_line() +
    ggtitle(myLabel[myLabelIndx]);myLabelIndx <- myLabelIndx + 1
  print(curvePlot)
}
fCrit_2_10 <- fCrit
```             

### Comments

(A) Corresponds to `ncp = 0`, which yields the usual (aka *central*) F-distribution that was used in the previous two chapters (9 and 10). The integral under this distribution is unity (this is true for all plots above). The critical value, `fCrit` in the code, is that value of `x` such that the probability of exceeding `x` is $\alpha$; in the current example `fCrit` = `r qf(0.95, ndf,ddf)`. Notice the use of the quantile function `qf()` to determine this value, also that the default value of `ncp`, namely zero, is used; specifically, one does not pass a 4th argument to `qf()`. **The decision rule for rejecting the NH uses the NH distribution of the F-statistic**, i.e., reject the NH if F >= `fCrit`. As expected, `prob > fCrit` = `r 1-pf(fCrit, ndf, ddf, ncp = ncp[1])` because this is how `fCrit` was defined. 
(B) Corresponds to `ncp = 2`. It is noticeably shifted to the right as compared to A, thereby making it more likely that the observed value of the F-statistic will exceed the critical value determined for the NH distribution. In fact, `prob > fCrit` = `r 1-pf(fCrit, ndf, ddf, ncp = ncp[2])`, which is the *statistical power*. 
(C) Corresponds to `ncp = 5`, and now `prob > fCrit` = `r 1-pf(fCrit, ndf, ddf, ncp = ncp[3])`. 
(D) Corresponds to `ncp = 10`, and now `prob > fCrit` is  `r 1-pf(fCrit, ndf, ddf, ncp = ncp[4])`. 
The effect of the shift is obvious in plots (C) and (D). Considering a vertical line at `x = 4.10`, most of the distribution in plot (D), more than `r 1-pf(fCrit, ndf, ddf, ncp = ncp[4])`, to be precise, lies to the right of this line, so the NH is more than `r 1-pf(fCrit, ndf, ddf, ncp = ncp[4])` likely to be rejected. Of course, what causes the shift is the increased value of the non-centrality parameter. The larger that non-centrality parameter, the greater the shift to the right.

```{r, fig.show='hold'}
ndf <- 2;ddf <- 100
fCrit <- qf(0.95, ndf,ddf)
cat("critical value of x for rejecting NH is ", fCrit,"\n")
x <- seq(1, 20, 0.1)
myLabel <- c("E", "F", "G", "H")
myLabelIndx <- 1
for (i in 1:length(ncp))
{
  y <- df(x,ndf,ddf,ncp=ncp[i])
  cat("ndf = ", ndf, ", ddf = ", ddf, ", ncp = ", ncp[i], ", prob > fCrit = ", 
      1-pf(fCrit, ndf, ddf, ncp = ncp[i]), "\n")
}  
for (i in 1:length(ncp))
{
  y <- df(x,ndf,ddf,ncp=ncp[i])
  curveData <- data.frame(x = x, pdf = y)
  curvePlot <- ggplot(data = curveData, mapping = aes(x = x, y = pdf)) + 
    geom_line() +
    ggtitle(myLabel[myLabelIndx]);myLabelIndx <- myLabelIndx + 1
  print(curvePlot)
}
fCrit_2_100 <- fCrit
```             

### Comments

(E) Corresponds to `ncp = 0`. The critical value is `fCrit_2_100` = `r qf(0.95, ndf,ddf)`. Notice the decrease compared to the previous value, i.e., `r qf(0.95, ndf,10)`, for ddf = 10. 
(F) Corresponds to `ncp = 2`, and `prob > fCrit_2_100` = `r 1-pf(fCrit_2_100, ndf, ddf, ncp = ncp[2])`, greater than the previous value `r 1-pf(fCrit_2_10, ndf, 10, ncp = ncp[2])`. 
(G) Corresponds to `ncp = 5`, and now `prob > fCrit_2_100` = `r 1-pf(fCrit_2_100, ndf, ddf, ncp = ncp[3])`. 
(H) Corresponds to `ncp = 10`, and now `prob > fCrit_2_100` is  `r 1-pf(fCrit_2_100, ndf, ddf, ncp = ncp[4])`.

### Comments

(I) Corresponds to `ncp = 0`. The critical value is `fCrit_1_100` = `r qf(0.95, ndf,ddf)`. Notice the increase compared to the corresponding value for `ndf = 2`, i.e., `r qf(0.95, 2,100)`.
(J) Corresponds to `ncp = 2`, and `prob > fCrit_1_100` = `r 1-pf(fCrit_1_100, ndf, ddf, ncp = ncp[2])`, larger than the previous value `r 1-pf(fCrit_2_100, 2, 100, ncp = ncp[2])`. 
(K) Corresponds to `ncp = 5`, and now `prob > fCrit_1_100` = `r 1-pf(fCrit_1_100, ndf, ddf, ncp = ncp[3])`, larger than the previous value `r 1-pf(fCrit_2_100, 2, 100, ncp = ncp[3])`. 
(L) Corresponds to `ncp = 10`, and now `prob > fCrit_1_100` is  `r 1-pf(fCrit_1_100, ndf, ddf, ncp = ncp[4])`, larger than the previous value `r 1-pf(fCrit_2_100, 2, 100, ncp = ncp[4])`. 

## Summary
Power increases with increasing `ddf` and `ncp`; the effect of increasing `ncp` is quite dramatic. Decreasing `ndf` also increases power. At first glance this may seem counterintuitive, as `fCrit` has gone up, but can be explained by the differing shapes of the two distributions: the pdf is broader for `ndf` = 1 as compared to `ndf` = 2 (compare plot L to H).
