Update History
==========================
## RJafroc 1.2.0.9000 ##
### Major changes ###

#### Added FROC sample size vignettes ####
* `Ch19Vig1FrocSampleSize.Rmd`:
* `Ch19Vig2FrocSampleSize.Rmd`:

#### Significance testing functions ####
* Corrected errors in `StSignificanceTesting()` and related functions affecting `method = "ORH"` and `covEstMethod = "Jackknife"`. I messed up while trying to simplify XZ code. 
* Ran Windows `JAFROC` on virtual Windows 8 machine and saved results to validate current significance testing functions. Included unit tests in `tests/testthat`.
* Ran first XZ CRAN upload (version 0.0.1) code (`StOldCode.R`) to compare against current significance testing code. Included unit tests in `tests/testthat`.
* test-St-Compare2JAFROC.R
* test-St-Compare2Org.R
* test-St-CompareDBM2OR.R

#### CAD and LROC #### 
* Corrected interpolation error in LROC PCL and ALROC FOMs. Hand calculations showed that the `approx` function did not work for small datasets. Wrote my own simple interpolation code. See **ChkLrocFoms.xlsx** in `inst/StSigTesting`. 
* LROC FOMs now apply to UtilFigureOfMerit() and all significance testing functions.
* Most FOM related functions now accept `FPFValue` to accommodate LROC datasets.
* CAD results updated; see `CadFunctionTests.R` in `inst/CadTesting`. See **CadTestingNicoData.xlsx** in `inst/CadTesting`. Included unit tests in `tests/testthat`.
* `SimulateLrocDataset`: FROC to LROC simulator based on RSM. Could be used for NH testing.
* `DfFroc2Lroc`: Simulates an "AUC-equivalent" LROC dataset from an FROC dataset.
* `DfLroc2Froc`: Simulates an "AUC-equivalent" FROC dataset from an LROC dataset.
* `DfLroc2Roc`: convert LROC dataset to ROC dataset.

#### variance component input #### 
* SignificanceTesting functions now accept variance components, without having to specify a dataset.

#### affected and new functions #### 
* `UtilVarComponentsDBM()`: 
* `UtilVarComponentsOR()`:
* `SsPowerGivenJKDbmVarComp`:
* `SsPowerGivenJKOrVarComp`:
* `StSignificanceTestingCadVsRadiologists`:
* `UtilLesionDistribution`:
* `UtilLesionWeightsDistr`:
* `SsSampleSizeKGivenJ`:
* `SsPowerGivenJK`:

#### FROC sample size #### 
* `SsFrocNhRsmModel`:

#### needs further testing #### 
* `StSignificanceTestingSingleFixedFactor`:
* `StSignificanceTestingSingleRandomFactor`:

#### extension needed #### 
* `PlotRsmOperatingCharacteristics`: to include LROC data



## RJafroc 1.2.0 ##
### Major changes ###
* Corrected all references to package name to `RJafroc` (note capitalization)
* Checked downstream dependencies - none as of July 23, 2019: revdep("RJafroc") yields character(0)
* Corrected error that was causing `Solaris` failure (Peter Philips)
* Corrected error in `UtilPseudoValues.R` that was caught by `testthat`
* Corrected `StSignificanceTesting.R` that was caught by `testthat` (Peter Philips)
* `R CMD check` generates `testthat` failure when run under `RStudio`, see following output, but not when run as
`devtools::test()`:

## RJafroc 1.1.0 ##
### Major changes ###
* Added `travis-ci` testing after each push; and build passing badges, etc. 
* Removed dependence on `caTools` package, which was not being supported; extracted function `trapz()` from it
   and inserted directly into `gpfMyFOM.R` - see comments in that file of what led to this
* Removed dependence on `xlsx` package, which requires `rJava` and `JAVA`, replaced with dependence on
   `openxlsx` package. Was having difficulty installing `rJava` correctly after each `OSX` or `R` update.
* Corrected errors in `UtilOutputReport.R`.
* Fixed bug in `UtilOutputReport` that was preventing overwriting of existing output file, even
   when the user keys "y" in response to prompt
* Added correlated contaminated binormal model, `CORCBM`, fitting and related functions to
   make package current with 2017 CORCBM publication.
* Fixed error in `PlotEmpiricalCharacteristics.R` that was giving incorrect plots for other than
   `ROC` and `wAFROC` plots
* Added `ChisqrGoodnessOfFit` function, replacing 3 functions
* Cleaned up plotting code; using one function `genericPlotROC.R` instead of 3 functions
* Updated results of CBM, PROPROC and RSM fitting after discovering error in df
   calculation in RSM chisquare statistic; book results are wrong; only 2/236 fits
   yield a valid chisquare statistic
* Renamed `ExampleCompare3ProperRocFits()` to `Compare3ProperRocFits()`
* Corrected overwriting error in value returned by `Compare3ProperRocFits()`
* Added two vignettes: `QuickStartDBMH` and `QuickStartDBMHExcelOutput`
* Checked downstream dependencies - none as of Nov 11, 2018: `revdep("rjafroc")` yields `character(0)`
   
==========================
## RJafroc 1.0.2 ##
### Minor bug ###
* StSignificanceTestingCadVsRadiologists was not working for different numbers of readers.
   As noted by Alejandro, the number of readers was hard coded. Fixed this and extended
   DfExtractDataset to include LROC datasets.
* Removed function `SsFROCPowerGivenJK`: FROC power is implemented in Online
  Appendix Chapter 19 (see email exchange with Kota Aoyagi)
* This package installed on SOLARIS.
   
==========================
## RJafroc 1.0.1 ##
### Minor bug ###
* Package was not installing on Solaris - overloading errors. Changed sqrt(2) in 
   RsmFuncs.cpp to sqrt(2.0). However, Solaris is incompatible with ggplot2; 
   so will recommend that Solaris version not be distributed on CRAN.
* Sorry, but I'm not sure what's different between the CRAN Solaris machine and 
   R-hub's Solaris machine. You could prepare a new package submission for CRAN 
   with the caveat that, since you do not have access to a Solaris machine, 
   your fix is speculative and may yet fail to compile on the CRAN Solaris machine.
* The CRAN Repository Policy (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html) 
   also states:  
   _Package authors should make all reasonable efforts to provide cross-platform 
   portable code. Packages will not normally be accepted that do not run on at 
   least two of the major R platforms. Cases for Windows-only packages will be 
   considered, but CRAN may not be the most appropriate place to host them. So 
   you could in theory argue your case that your package does not support Solaris, 
   and request that CRAN not distribute your package on that platform. But given 
   that the issue you're bumping to is (not) documented explicitly in the R manuals, 
   I'm not sure how much success you would have._

==========================
## RJafroc 1.0.0 ##
### Major changes ###
* Renamed functions for better organization; 
* Removed shiny GUI interface
* Support for LROC datasets and cross-modality datasets
* CAD vs. radiologist analysis, both single modality and dual modality

## RJafroc 0.1.1 ##
### Bug fixes ###
* A critcal error in the *p* value calculation that gave incorrect *p* value (possibly exceeding one) when the first modality performed better than 2nd has been fixed. Thanks to Lucy D'Agostino McGowan for pointing out the error and the fix. This error, which does not occur in Windows version of JAFROC V 4.2.1, was not noticed as in all example files the 2nd modality performed better.

## RJafroc 0.1.0 ##
### Major change ###
* A "shiny" based GUI has been added, accessed by the function `RJafrocGui()`. This allows a user only interested in
analyzing a data file to access the underlying code in a "user friendly" way. The GUI is similar in functionality to
that of Windows JAFROC 4.2.1 software.

### Minor bug and aesthetic fixes ###
* For the curve plotting functions, legend position and direction are automatically decided if they are not explicityly specified. 
* The the output number of significant digits for statistical power in power table has been set to 3.
* Variance and covariance calculation error for ROI data has been fixed.
* A bug in the JAFROC data reading function that caused an error when encountering non-numeric values has been fixed.
* Floating point ratings are rounded to 6 significant digits when saving a dataset in JAFROC format. 
* A bug in the plotting routine that affected plots for a single rating FROC dataset has been fixed.
* A bug in the plotting of AFROC curves for a dataset containing only non-diseased cases has been fixed.

## RJafroc 0.0.1 ##
* Original version posted to CRAN (with Xuetong help)
