\description{
This is referred to in the book as the "DOB1" dataset. Dobbins et al conducted a 
multi-institutional, MRMC study to compare the performance of digital tomosynthesis 
(GE's VolumeRad device), dual-energy (DE) imaging, and conventional chest 
radiography for pulmonary nodule detection and management. 
All study images were obtained with a flat-panel detector developed by GE. 
The case set consisted of 158 subjects, of which 43 were non-diseased and 
the rest had 1 - 20 pulmonary nodules independently verified, using with CT 
images, by 3 experts who did not participate in the observer study. The 
study used FROC paradigm data collection. There are 
4 treatments labeled 1 - 4 (conventional chest x-ray, CXR, CXR augmented
with dual-energy (CXR+DE), VolumeRad digital tomosynthesis images and 
VolumeRad augmented with DE (VolumeRad+DE).
