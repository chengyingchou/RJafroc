   2 Notes (arch 'i386' and arch 'x64') CPU time > 5 s: these examples of maximum likelihood fitting from clinical
      datasets are as minimal as I can make them while illustrating the analytical techniques
   Similar note on Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1, R-devel, 32/64 bit
   In all cases time is still less than 7s
   1 Note on Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS, R-release, GCC regarding possibly misspelled words, all FPs
   Debian Linux, R-devel, GCC ASAN/UBSAN: OK
   1 Error on Fedora Linux, R-devel, clang, gfortran: 
      Error in loadNamespace(j <- i[[1L]], c(lib.loc, .libPaths()), versionCheck = vI[[j]]) : 
      there is no package called lattice
      I believe this is a false positive as my package does not depend on *lattice*
      See independent check on R-hub builder below, which gives different error
