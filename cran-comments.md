# Overall
* This is an update to CRAN version 1.2.0 which installed with no errors, warnings or notes (2019-07-31) on all platforms except `r-devel-windows-ix86+x86_64-gcc8`, which generated the following file size NOTE:
````
Version: 1.2.0 
Check: installed package size 
Result: NOTE 
     installed size is 5.2Mb
     sub-directories of 1Mb or more:
     libs 2.2Mb 
````
* This update corrects bugs noted by some users and introduces greater flexibility for future observer performance study designs (e.g., split-plot designs). 

* I have eliminated the file-size NOTE in all tested platforms. 

# Test environments

## OSX
* iMac, 3.4GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7
* `"x86_64-apple-darwin15.6.0", "arch x86_64", "os darwin 15.6.0" "R version 3.6.1 (2019-07-05)"` 
* `R CMD check` ran with no errors, warnings or notes

## Travis
* No errors, warnings or notes on `oldrel`,`release` or `developer`. 

## Windows portability
1. This was tested using `devtools`
1. `devtools::check_win_devel`, `devtools::check_win_release` and `devtools::check_win_oldrelease`: these generated one note each:  
* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE
Maintainer: 'Dev Chakraborty <dpc10ster@gmail.com>'. This is expected because I am the maintainer.

## Other platform portability
1. CRAN compatibility was tested using `rhub::check_for_cran()`: This yielded 2 NOTES:
1. The first note is that I am the maintainer, which I attest is true.
2. The second note states:
Found the following files/directories:
     'RJafroc-Ex_i386.Rout' 'RJafroc-Ex_x64.Rout' 'examples_i386'
     'examples_x64'
I have checked the installation directory carefully, and I believe the above files are absent.
1. Additionally, the tests cited possibly misspelled words in DESCRIPTION file, all of which are false positives.

## Further checks were conducted across all platforms implemented in `rhub::platforms()`

### `debian-clang-devel`:
  Debian Linux, R-devel, clang, ISO-8859-15 locale: This failed with following message: Error in loadNamespace(name) : there is no package called 'BiocManager'. My namespace does not contain `BiocManager`.
  
### `debian-gcc-devel`:
  Debian Linux, R-devel, GCC: Generated 0 errors, 0 warnings and 3 NOTES.
1. The first note is that I am the maintainer, which I attest is true.

1. Examples with CPU (user + system) or elapsed time > 5s
                                         user system elapsed
  `SsSampleSizeKGivenJ`                   5.096  0.040  14.656
  `PlotEmpiricalOperatingCharacteristics` 2.448  0.012   6.607
  `UtilPseudoValues`                      2.340  0.020   6.030
  `Df2RJafrocDataset`                     2.076  0.048   6.090
  `PlotRsmOperatingCharacteristics`       1.528  0.016   5.080
I could remove these examples, but since they are not occurring on OSX and Windows, I am reluctant to do so. Also, the `SsSampleSizeKGivenJ` examples are among the least understood and most useful parts of the software and by their very nature involve somewhat larger datasets (Toy datasets would not work). I hope to be given some latitude.
  
### `debian-gcc-devel-nold`:
  Debian Linux, R-devel, GCC, no long double: This generated 3 NOTES, the first two identical to the ones just stated above.
1. The third NOTE states:
  Examples with CPU (user + system) or elapsed time > 5s
                       user system elapsed
  `SsSampleSizeKGivenJ` 4.812   0.04   6.498
  
Response is identical to that for a similar NOTE above, namely I could remove these examples, but since they are not occurring on OSX and Windows, I am reluctant to do so. Also, the `SsSampleSizeKGivenJ` examples are among the least understood and most useful parts of the software and by their very nature involve somewhat larger datasets (Toy datasets would not work). I hope to be given some latitude.
  
### `debian-gcc-patched`:
  Debian Linux, R-patched, GCC:  Generated 0 errors, 0 warnings and 2 NOTES.
1. A note is that I am the maintainer, which is true.
2. A NOTE stating: checking examples ... NOTE
