# Overall #
* This is an update to CRAN version 1.2.0 which installed with no errors, warnings or notes (2019-07-31) on all platforms except `r-devel-windows-ix86+x86_64-gcc8`, which generated the following file size NOTE:
Version: 1.2.0 
Check: installed package size 
Result: NOTE 
     installed size is 5.2Mb
     sub-directories of 1Mb or more:
     libs 2.2Mb 

* This update corrects bugs noted by some users and introduces greater flexibility for future observer performance study designs (e.g., split-plot designs). 

* Unfortunately, it does not correct the file size NOTE. I have attempted to minimize file size by removing vignettes and tests,  but I am down to what I consider the basic minimum. A remaining option, yet to be exercised, is to break the package up into two or more packages, but this would delay publication. 

# Test environments #

## OSX ##
* iMac, 3.4GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7
* `"x86_64-apple-darwin15.6.0", "arch x86_64", "os darwin 15.6.0" "R version 3.6.1 (2019-07-05)"` 
* `R CMD check` ran with no errors, warnings or notes

## Travis ##
* No errors, warnings or notes on `oldrel`,`release` or `developer`. 

## Windows portability ##
1. This was tested using `devtools`
1. `devtools::check-windevel`: one note next to * checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE
Maintainer: 'Dev Chakraborty <dpc10ster@gmail.com>'. This is expected because I am the maintainer
1. `devtools::check_win_release`: this generates one note, identical to that shown above.  This is expected because I am the maintainer.
1. `devtools::check_win_oldrelease`: two notes, one identical to that shown above, which is expected because I am the maintainer. The other note states: installed size is 6.3Mb, sub-directories of 1Mb or more: `doc` 2.0Mb, `libs` 1.6Mb
I have reduced the number of vignettes from 20 (available on GitHub) to 2 for CRAN submission. I would ask for an exception so that at least these two can be included. I would have to remove both of them to reduce below 5 MB (each contributes about 1 MB, so removing just one would not do it). The `libs` directory appears to be due to the Windows OS (it does not appear in OSX). 

## Other platform portability ##
1. This was checked on `rhub` using `devtools::check_rhub()`
1. Most of them cited possibly misspelled words in DESCRIPTION file, which are all false positives.
1. The checks were conducted across all platforms implemented in `rhub::platforms()`

### `debian-clang-devel`:
  Debian Linux, R-devel, clang, ISO-8859-15 locale: This failed with following message: Error in loadNamespace(name) : there is no package called 'BiocManager'. My namespace does not contain `BiocManager`.
  
### `debian-gcc-devel`:
  Debian Linux, R-devel, GCC: Generated 0 errors, 0 warnings and 3 NOTES.
1. The first note is that I am the maintainer, which is true.
1. NOTE installed package size ... 
    installed size is  5.0Mb
    sub-directories of 1Mb or more:
      `doc`   2.0Mb
I believe 5 MB is allowd on CRAN and for reasons stated earlier, I am down to only 2 vignettes from 20, and would be reluctant to reduce it even further. For the end-user, the vignettes are among the most useful parts of the package.

1. Examples with CPU (user + system) or elapsed time > 5s
                                         user system elapsed
  `SsSampleSizeKGivenJ`                   5.096  0.040  14.656
  `PlotEmpiricalOperatingCharacteristics` 2.448  0.012   6.607
  `UtilPseudoValues`                      2.340  0.020   6.030
  `Df2RJafrocDataset`                     2.076  0.048   6.090
  `PlotRsmOperatingCharacteristics`       1.528  0.016   5.080
I could remove these examples, but since they are not occurring on OSX and Windows, I am reluctant to do so. Also, the `SsSampleSizeKGivenJ` examples are among the least understood and most useful parts of the software and by their very nature involve somewhat larger datasets (Toy datasets would not work). I hope to be given some latitude.
  
### `debian-gcc-devel-nold`:
  Debian Linux, R-devel, GCC, no long double
1. This generated 3 NOTES, the first two identical to the ones just stated above.
3. The third NOTE states:
  Examples with CPU (user + system) or elapsed time > 5s
                       user system elapsed
  `SsSampleSizeKGivenJ` 4.812   0.04   6.498
  
Response is identical to that for a similar NOTE above, namely I could remove these examples, but since they are not occurring on OSX and Windows, I am reluctant to do so. Also, the `SsSampleSizeKGivenJ` examples are among the least understood and most useful parts of the software and by their very nature involve somewhat larger datasets (Toy datasets would not work). I hope to be given some latitude.
  
### `debian-gcc-patched`:
  Debian Linux, R-patched, GCC:  Generated 0 errors, 0 warnings and 3 NOTES.

1. NOTE installed package size ... 
    installed size is  5.0Mb

    sub-directories of 1Mb or more:
      `doc`    2.0Mb
      `libs`   2.7Mb
      
This is larger than for other tests I have run. I believe 5 MB is allowd on CRAN and for reasons stated earlier, I am down to only 2 vignettes from 20, and would be reluctant to reduce it even further. For the end-user, the vignettes are among the most useful parts of the package. I have no control over the `libs` sub-directory, which does not appear in OSX.
