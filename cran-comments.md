# Reason for submission
* This is an update to CRAN version 1.3.2 which installed with no errors, warnings, or notes (2020-03-06) on all platforms.
* This update includes includes significant improvements to the code, some as a result of user-reported bugs and others discovered in independent testing.

# Test environments

## OS X
* iMac, 3.4GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7
* "x86_64-apple-darwin17.0", 
* "R version 4.0.3 (2020-10-10)" 
* `R CMD check` ran with no errors, warnings or notes

## GitHub Action
* No errors, warnings or notes on `oldrel`,`release` or `developer`. 

## Windows portability
* This was tested using `devtools::check_win_devel`, `devtools::check_win_release` and `devtools::check_win_oldrelease`: each of these generated 1 note, namely that the maintainer is 'Dev Chakraborty <dpc10ster@gmail.com>', which is expected because I am the maintainer.


## CRAN compatibility
1. CRAN compatibility was tested using `rhub::check_for_cran()`: This yielded 1 note, which stated (for Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1, R-devel, 32/64 bit): "Found the following files/directories: 'RJafroc-Ex_i386.Rout' 'RJafroc-Ex_x64.Rout' 'examples_i386' 'examples_x64'"
1. I have checked the installation directory carefully, and the above files are absent. Moreover, the checks performed on this platform using `rhub::check(platform = "windows-x86_64-devel")` passed, see below. I suspect this note is a false positive.

## Further checks were conducted across all platforms implemented in `rhub::platforms()`
