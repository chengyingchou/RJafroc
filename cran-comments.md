# This is a new submission #
A C++11 compilation error on Solaris resulted in archival of the previous version on 2019-01-17.
This error has been corrected.

## Test environments ##
### OSX "x86_64-apple-darwin15.6.0", "R version 3.6.1 (2019-07-05)" ###
* R CMD check ran with 0 errors, warnings or notes
### Windows portability was tested on win-builder.r-project.org ###
* Both release and development versions of R generated 1 Note, which was expected, stating that this was a new submission, and that the previous one had been archived. 
* The old-release version generated an additional note stating that the installed size is 6.2Mb, and two sub-directories of 1Mb or more: were identified (doc: 2.1Mb and libs: 1.7Mb). 
* _We have taken care to minimize file size by compressing all image files used in the vignettes_.

   2 Notes (arch 'i386' and arch 'x64') CPU time > 5 s: these examples of maximum likelihood fitting from clinical
      datasets are as minimal as I can make them while illustrating the analytical techniques
   Similar note on Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1, R-devel, 32/64 bit
   In all cases time is still less than 7s
   1 Note on Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS, R-release, GCC regarding possibly misspelled words, all FPs
   Debian Linux, R-devel, GCC ASAN/UBSAN: OK
   1 Error on Fedora Linux, R-devel, clang, gfortran: 
      Error in loadNamespace(j <- i[[1L]], c(lib.loc, .libPaths()), versionCheck = vI[[j]]) : 
      there is no package called lattice
      I believe this is a false positive as my package does not depend on *lattice*
      See independent check on R-hub builder below, which gives different error
