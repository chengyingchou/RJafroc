# What is this repository for? #
* Modeling, Analysis, Validation and Visualization of ROC/FROC studies
* Extends and replaces the *obsolete* Windows software (JAFROC: http://www.devchakraborty.com)

# Documentation (vignettes) available at https://dpc10ster.github.io/RJafroc/ #

# My wiki is at https://github.com/dpc10ster/RJafroc/wiki #

# A CRAN version of RJafroc is in preparation #
Thanks to help from Dr. Peter Phillips, a version of `RJafroc` that should pass CRAN tests is close to completion. As usual, the most current version of the software is available right here.

# Those already familiar with installing R packages from GitHub can ignore the following directions #  

# How do I get set up? #
## Short version: install directly from GitHub using package `devtools` ##
* Install `R` and `RStudio`.
* Create an empty directory, e.g., `myProject`. In my computer it is `/Users/Dev/Downloads/myProject`.
* Open `RStudio`. 
* Starting from `RStudio` > `File` > `New Project` > `Existing Directory` > Select `myProject` > `Create Project`.
* Oila! You should see `myProject.RProj` in the Files menu.
* Install the `devtools` package as shown below: 
* Starting from `RStudio` > `Packages` > `Install` > `devtools`.
* Load `devtools` as shown below:
```
library(devtools)
```
* Install `RJafroc` directly from `GitHub` (this is where `devtools` is used):
```
install_github("dpc10ster/rjafroc")
```
* Hit Enter on any prompts...
* Lots of activity and compilation of C++ code ....
* Load `RJafroc` as shown below:
```
library(RJafroc)
```
* Test the installation:
```
cbmPlot <- PlotCbmFit(c(1, 2), c(0.5, 0.5))
print(cbmPlot)
```
* You should see two ROC plots in the `Plots` window.
* Preliminary documentation (vignettes) is available at https://dpc10ster.github.io/RJafroc/.
* Be sure to study these examples and make full use of the online documentation.
* Put your data and other files, if any, in `myProject`.
* TBA

## Long version: download the `RJafroc` package and install from the downloaded files ##
* Clone this repository to a directory anywhere on your computer. On my computer it is in /Users/Dev/Downloads/rjafroc. Rename the folder if necessary to match my example. 
* I find the GitHub desktop app useful in mananging my downloads/uploads from Git.
* Install `R` and `RStudio`.
* Navigate to the `rjafroc` directory.
* Open `RJafroc.Rproj`. This will open `RStudio`. 
* Navigate to `File` menu (lower-right window) and click on DESCRIPTION file.
* Install all packages listed under Imports, e.g.,    
    openxlsx,
    ggplot2,
    stringr,
    tools,
    utils,
    stats,
    bbmle,
    binom,
    mvtnorm,
    dplyr,
    numDeriv,
    Rcpp
* For example, to install the first two above-listed packages, use the following command at the Console prompt:
```
install.packages(c("openxlsx", "ggplot2"))
```
* Click on Build > Install and Restart (upper right panel). If errors result from missing packages, install those packages.
* A successful Install and Restart will result in the following line in the Console window:
```
library(RJafroc)
```
* Thats it! `RJafroc` has been installed to your computer and is visible to any other `R` project in any directory.
* You will not need to access the `RJafroc` folder again (unless you reinstall a new version of the software). 
* All necessary files of the installation are in a hidden directory that you do not normally need to worry about.
* Create an empty directory, e.g., `myProject`. In my computer it is `/Users/Dev/Downloads/myProject`.
* Starting from `RStudio` > `File` > `New Project` > `Existing Directory` > `myProject` > `Create Project`.
* Oila! You should see `myProject.RProj` in the Files menu.
* Click on `Packages` and scroll down to find `RJafroc`, and check the box next to it. This results in `RJafroc` being loaded to the current workspace. The following line appears in the Console window (this is the hidden directory referrred to above).
```
  library("RJafroc", lib.loc="/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/3.5/Resources/library")
```  
* Click on `RJafroc` in the packages window. A help window opens up. I find it convenient to put this in its own window by clicking the "out" arrow button (hover message: Show in new window). You can access all documentation from here.
* Test the installation:
```
cbmPlot <- PlotCbmFit(c(1, 2), c(0.5, 0.5))
print(cbmPlot)
```
* You should see two ROC plots in the `Plots` window.
* Preliminary documentation (vignettes) is available at https://dpc10ster.github.io/RJafroc/.
* Put your data and other files, if any, in myProject.
